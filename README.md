# portfolio-generator

## Description
This application makes it easy for users to build a portfolio in a matter of minutes! Creating and maintaining a portfolio can be time consuming work, especially when you feel that your time would be better spent programming the applications than talking about them! This command-line application makes it so that engineers, developers, and programmers can spend their time doing what they love.  

## Usage
Once the application has been initialized using the `node app.js` command, the user will be guided through a series of questions and the user's answers will populate the content to be contained within the HTML template that will be returned. Users can be as brief or detailed as they find necessary.

The program even allows users to indicate whether or not they should 'Feature' the project and make it stand out amongst all of the projects that they decide to include. Once the questions have been completed, an HTML page will be returned to the user and this file can be found in the `dist` folder within the project.
